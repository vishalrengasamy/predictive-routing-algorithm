# predictive-routing-algorithm
A routing algorithm that uses the data from an ultrasonic sensor, placed on dustbins across different coordinates, and based on a predictive formula, determines if a dustbin needs to be emptied the following day, and also returns the optimal route through all the dustbins, starting from the depot.
